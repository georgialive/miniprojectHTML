                My name is Georgia Vrana and I was born in Ontario, Canada. I am currently 15-years-old
                and I have a large passion for coding. I have a lot of experience using Java, however I am looking towards
                broadening my horizons and trying some FrontEnd coding as well. I am a former national level swimmer for my age group,
                and I enjoy teaching kids how to swim. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time play piano for the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM), I am also currently practicing 
                music for Christmas time (my personal favourite on the piano is White Christmas). I enjoy watching anime 
                in my free-time and my favourite coding language so far is Java.

                These are some the projects I have been doing (well the most impressive ones). Most of them are using Java and work
                with doing math and adding numbers and doing functions. However, I got a really firm grasp on the different methods at 
                one point in my projects, and it really shows with how much more organized my projects are.
            </p>
            <p>
                The projects in here will also include some of my school collabrative work projects (using Eclipse and Java), however there are also some
                personal passion projects in here that I did independently on my own time.
